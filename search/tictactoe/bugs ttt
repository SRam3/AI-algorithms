There are several bugs in this code:

In the result function, the code raises an exception when an invalid move is made, but it should return the current board instead.

In the winner function, the code checks for a winner by checking rows, columns, and diagonals individually. However, it does not check for a tie.

In the terminal function, the code returns True if there is a winner, but it should return True if there is a winner or a tie.

In the minimax function, the code is missing the implementation of the min_value function, which is called in the else statement of the function.

In the max_value function, the variable 'v' is initialized with -inf, which would make the first action return -inf in case of no terminal state.

min_value function is missing, which should return the minimum value of the board

In the utility function, the code returns 1 if X has won, but it should return 1 if the current player has won.

In the minimax function, the code is missing the implementation of the argmax and argmin functions, which are used to find the optimal action for the current player on the board.

In the max_value function, the function is missing the implementation of the argmax function, which is used to find the optimal action for the current player on the board.

In the min_value function, the function is missing the implementation of the argmin function, which is used to find the optimal action for the current player on the board.




seramirezra@unal.edu.co
give me the correct code for every bug found
Here is the corrected code for each of the bugs:

In the result function, change:
Copy code
if board_copy[action[0]][action[1]] != EMPTY:
    raise Exception("Invalid move")
to:

Copy code
if board_copy[action[0]][action[1]] != EMPTY:
    return board_copy
In the winner function, check for a tie by adding the following code after the for loop:
Copy code
if not any(None in row for row in board):
    return "TIE"
In the terminal function, change:
Copy code
if winner(board) != None:
    return True
to:

Copy code
if winner(board) != None or not any(None in row for row in board):
    return True
In the minimax function, add the following function:
Copy code
def min_value(board):
    """
    Returns the minimum value of the board
    """
    v = math.inf # worst possible outcome for the current player
    if terminal(board):
        return utility(board) # return the utility of the board once the game has ended (i.e. terminal state)
    for action in actions(board):
        v = min(v, max_value(result(board, action)))
    return v
In the max_value function, change:
Copy code
v = -math.inf
to:

Copy code
v = -math.inf
for action in actions(board):
    v = max(v, min_value(result(board, action)))
return v
In the minimax function, add the following code to find the optimal action for the current player:
Copy code
def argmax(iterable, func):
    return max(iterable, key=func)

def argmin(iterable, func):
    return min(iterable, key=func)
In the utility function, change:
Copy code
if winner(board) == X:
    return 1
to:

Copy code
if winner(board) == player(board):
    return 1
In the minimax function, add the following code to find the optimal action for the current player:
Copy code
if player(board) == X:
    return argmax(actions(board), lambda action: min_value(result(board, action)))
else:
    return argmin(actions(board), lambda action: max_value(result(board, action)))
In the max_value function, add the following code to find the optimal action for the current player:
Copy code
return argmax(actions(board), lambda action: min_value(result(board, action)))
In the min_value function, add the following code to find the optimal action for the current player:
Copy code
return argmin(actions(board), lambda action: max_value(result(board, action)))
Please note that this code is just a skeleton and you might need to tweak it to match your requirement and also
